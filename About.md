# Single-Cell-RNA-Sequencing
Single-cell sequencing is reshaping biology by letting scientists decode gene expression cell by cell, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk experiments miss. From understanding cancer evolution to mapping immune responses, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is now a core skill in modern life sciences.
